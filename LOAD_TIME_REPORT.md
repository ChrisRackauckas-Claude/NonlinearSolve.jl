- The `@compile_workload` appears effective for basic use cases
- Runtime performance is excellent after first compilation
- TTFX could be improved by better precompilation of LinearSolve

## Recommendations

### 🚀 **High Impact Optimizations**

1. **LinearSolve Optimization** (Highest Priority)
   - Investigate LinearSolve.jl's precompilation strategy
   - Consider lazy loading of specific linear solvers
   - Profile LinearSolve.jl load time separately
   - Coordinate with LinearSolve.jl maintainers on load time improvements

2. **Enhanced Precompilation Workload**
   - Expand `@compile_workload` to include LinearSolve operations
   - Add common algorithm combinations to precompilation
   - Include typical ForwardDiff usage patterns

3. **Lazy Extension Loading**
   - Make heavy extensions truly optional
   - Load extensions only when needed
   - Consider moving some extensions to separate packages

### ⚡ **Medium Impact Optimizations**

4. **Sub-Package Optimization**
   - Review NonlinearSolveFirstOrder load time (0.248s)
   - Optimize SimpleNonlinearSolve loading patterns
   - Consider breaking up large sub-packages

5. **Dependency Review**
   - Audit if all dependencies are necessary at load time
   - Consider optional dependencies for advanced features
   - Review SparseArrays usage patterns

### 📊 **Low Impact Optimizations**

6. **Incremental Improvements**

   - Review extension loading order

## Comparison with Similar Packages

For context, typical load times in the Julia ecosystem:
- **Fast packages**: <0.1s (Pkg, LinearAlgebra)
- **Medium packages**: 0.1-0.5s (Plots.jl first backend)
- **Heavy packages**: 0.5-2.0s (DifferentialEquations.jl, MLJ.jl)
- **Very heavy**: >2.0s (Makie.jl)

**NonlinearSolve.jl at ~1.8s falls into the "heavy" category**, which is reasonable given its comprehensive feature set and numerical computing focus.

## Conclusion

NonlinearSolve.jl's load time is primarily dominated by its LinearSolve.jl dependency. While the current load time of ~1.8 seconds is within the acceptable range for a heavy numerical package, there are clear optimization opportunities:

1. **Primary focus**: Optimize LinearSolve.jl integration and loading
2. **Secondary focus**: Enhance precompilation workloads  
3. **Long-term**: Consider architectural changes for lazy loading

The package demonstrates excellent runtime performance after initial compilation, indicating that the precompilation strategy is working well for execution, but could be improved for load time.

**Overall Assessment: The load time is reasonable for the feature set, but optimization opportunities exist, particularly around the LinearSolve.jl dependency.**
